Mantelli and Schoof, ‘Ice sheet flow with thermally activated sliding. Part 2: the stability of subtemperate regions’, RSPA 2019 (MS)

This code contains the numerical solver for the steady state solution of a flow line model with subtemperate sliding in MHS, and the corresponding numerical stability analysis in MS. 

Figures 6-7 of Part I and 2-3 of part II can be reproduced using the corresponding scripts (note that simulation results are also appended). The script steady_state.m computes steady state solutions for a full flow line.
