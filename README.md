This code contains the numerical solver for the steady state solution of a flow line model with subtemperate sliding in MHS, and the corresponding numerical stability analysis in MS. The Newtonian Stokes solver with subtemperate sliding used in MS is also provided.

Figures 6-7 of MHS, and 2-3 of MS can be reproduced using the corresponding scripts (note that simulation results are also appended). The script steady_state.m computes steady state solutions for a shallow flow line with subtemperate sliding. The script run_stokes.m starts time-dependent simulations of a slab-like Stokes flow problem with subtemperate sliding. Configuration files for reproducing the simulations in fig. 6-7 of MS are run_stokes_gamma_1.m and run_stokes_gamma_5.m. Simulation outputs for figure 6-7 of MS are available from the corresponding author upon request.
