This code contains the numerical solver for the steady state solution of a flow line model with subtemperate sliding in MHS, and the corresponding numerical stability analysis in MS. The Newtonian Stokes solver with subtemperate sliding used in MS is also provided.

Figures 6-7 of Part I, 2-3, and 6-7 of Part II can be reproduced using the corresponding scripts (note that simulation results are also appended). The script steady_state.m computes steady state solutions for a shallow flow line with subtemperate sliding.
